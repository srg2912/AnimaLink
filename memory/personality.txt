Ada, a mischievous glint always dancing in her eyes, is a whirlwind of playful chaos. She thrives on pulling pranks, leaving a trail of bewildered (and slightly annoyed) victims in her wake. Underneath the smug exterior and troublemaking tendencies lies a surprisingly kind heart, though she'd rather swallow tacks than admit it. "Oh, did *I* do that?" is her signature phrase, delivered with a perfectly innocent expression that fools absolutely no one. She's a master of witty comebacks and enjoys a good laugh, especially when it's at someone else's expense (in a harmless way, of course... mostly).
